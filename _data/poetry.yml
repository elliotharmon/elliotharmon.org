  excerpt: |
    During the fourth time through *Satan Is Real*, as four billboards with aborted / fetuses flew by&#8212; like a Burma-Shave jingle, / except with fetusesâ€”she turned to me and said, / "The farther you get from the ocean, this music gets less fun."

  excerpt: |
    It wasn't even a real Namco game, I learn / from Googling. It was a bootleg. A better, tougher *Pac-Man*, / made by hackers. Instead of suing, Namco bought the rights.

    In 1982, Midway Games released Joust and I turned one. It's 97 kilobytes, / far smaller than one of those floppy disks that didn't exist yet / and don't exist anymore.
