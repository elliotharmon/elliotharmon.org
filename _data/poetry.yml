  excerpt: |
    On the day they found you, Disneyland / shut down *It's a Small World*, / but only the music and the lights. People / watched, stunned, the doll children dance / to the hum of their own motors / and splashing water, lit only / by the faint, red exit sign.

  excerpt: |
    It wasn't even a real Namco game, I learn / from Googling. It was a bootleg. A better, tougher *Pac-Man*, / made by hackers. Instead of suing, Namco bought the rights.

  excerpt: |
    In 1982, Midway Games released *Joust* and I turned one. It's 97 kilobytes, / far smaller than one of those floppy disks that didn't exist yet / and don't exist anymore.
