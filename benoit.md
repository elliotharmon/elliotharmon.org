*June 25, 2007*


#### One ####

On the day they found you, Disneyland 

shut down *It's a Small World*,  
but only the music and the lights. People 

watched, stunned, the doll children dance  
to the hum of their own motors 

and splashing water, lit only  
by the faint, red exit sign. So popular, 

extra line-holding ropes were flown in  
from Hong Kong. Cast members 

have been told to contravene. Sometimes  
they answer, "We were closed that day."
<br /><br />


#### Two ####

On the day they found you, a teenager 

across the street had written on my car,  
<small>SO MATERIAL A DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE,</small>

<small>NOT WHAT ILLS ARE SUFFERED, BUT  
WHAT KIND OF MAN SUFFERS THEM.  </small>

The milkman said, “I heard they're gonna  
Photoshop him out of the tapes, just like

the old logo.” I said, “I don't think that's funny.”  
He said, “It is. You want this milk or not?” 

I sat on the front step and drank  
the full bottle, watching *The Price Is Right*

through the neighbors' window.  
I haven't mentioned the graffiti yet. 
<br /><br />


#### Three ####

On the day they found you, fat weathermen 

in no less than nine major cities  
forewent their presentations altogether 

to perform Schoenberg's *A Survivor*  
*from Warsaw* a capella. Each insists 

it dawned on him to do so at the moment,  
but was not surprised about the others. 

Only one anchor, in Cincinnati, tried  
to stop him. She's been graciously 

transferred to a mailroom at a partner station.  
I read on Wikipedia that Naxos 

was compiling an album, but I can't find that  
anymore. It might have been a prank. 
<br /><br />


#### Four ####

On the day they found you, my football coach 

was voiceless. Having tried in vain  
to draw some Xs on the chalkboard, 

he put down the chalk  
and watched us breathe. I thought 

I saw him mouth, "I'm sorry."  
Finally the quarterback stood up, 

picked up the chalk, and scribbled  
integral formulas. First the basic ones 

from college, then some tougher ones.  
He'd fill the board and quickly smear it 

with his arm and start again, until the board  
was only a large, white, dusty rectangle. 
<br /><br />


#### Five ####

On the day they found you, priests 

gave their flocks choke holds and the tooth fairy  
gave my niece *No Way Out 2006*. She told me 

that she would be a wrestler when she grew up.  
I didn't tell her it had been the day 

I'd finally stopped wanting to grow up  
and be a wrestler, but Chris, I did give her 

a suplex and locked her leg until she tapped,  
almost in tears from laughter. 
<br /><br />


#### Six ####

On the day they found you, I 

couldn't even think of anyone  
to call, so I watched some matches 

online. They'd Photoshopped  
you out, just like the old logo, so Triple H 

writhed in your invisible arms,  
and when he finally tapped, they played 

your music and the crowd around  
the empty ring chanted bleeps.
